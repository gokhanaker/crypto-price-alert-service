# Crypto Price Alert Service

A Node.js-based cryptocurrency price alert service that enables users to set alerts for cryptocurrency price fluctuations. Built with TypeScript, Express, PostgreSQL, and Prisma.

## üöÄ Features

- **User Registration & Authentication**: Registering user with secure password hashing and JWT-based authentication
- **Cryptocurrency Management**: Real-time price data from CoinGecko API
- **Enhanced Price Alerts**: Set alerts for when prices go above or below target values
- **Automatic Price Updates**: Cron job scheduler updates prices every minute
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against API abuse
- **Enhanced Security**: Helmet security headers and CORS configuration
- **Health Monitoring**: Detailed health check endpoint with system metrics

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT
- **Validation**: Joi
- **External API**: CoinGecko for cryptocurrency data
- **Testing**: Jest
- **Logging**: Winston
- **Security**: Helmet, Rate Limiting

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Decisions

### CoinGecko API Integration

**Decision**: Integrated with CoinGecko API for real-time cryptocurrency price data.

- CoinGecko provides reliable, free cryptocurrency price data
- Supports 10,000+ cryptocurrencies with comprehensive market data
- No API key required for basic usage (rate-limited)

### Scheduler Implementation

**Decision**: Implemented a cron-based scheduler to automatically update cryptocurrency prices with real market data.

- Ensures price data is always current and accurate
- Reduces dependency on manual price updates
- Enables real-time alert triggering

### Event-Driven Architecture

**Decision**: Implemented event-emitting system for alert notifications with simulation capabilities.

**Current Implementation (Development/Testing)**:
- Uses Node.js EventEmitter for internal event handling
- EventController simulates multiple notification types (email, push, SMS)

**Production Deployment Considerations**:
- **Current**: Events are simulated within the same service
- **Recommended**: In a real deployed project, events should be emitted to external services:
  - **Message Queue**: Use Redis/RabbitMQ/Kafka for event distribution
  - **Notification Service**: Separate microservice for handling notifications

**Event Flow (Production)**:
```
Alert Triggered ‚Üí Event Bus ‚Üí Notification Service ‚Üí Email/Push/SMS Services
```

## üìã Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm or yarn

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Clone and Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gokhanaker/crypto-price-alert-service
cd crypto-price-alert-service
npm install
cp env.example .env
```

### 2. Start Database and Server

```bash
# Start PostgreSQL container and setup database
docker-compose up -d postgres
./scripts/setup-db.sh

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### 3. Network Requirements

**Important**: This service requires internet connectivity to fetch real-time cryptocurrency prices from the CoinGecko API. Some WiFi networks or corporate firewalls may block connections to cryptocurrency APIs or websites. If you encounter connection issues:

- Ensure your network allows connections to `api.coingecko.com`
- Check if your WiFi settings block cryptocurrency-related websites
- Consider using a different network if your current one has restrictions


The server will start on `http://localhost:6000`
Your database will contain 10 default cryptocurrencies ready for development.
